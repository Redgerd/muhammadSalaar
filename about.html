            Thanks for dropping by! My name’s Salaar—and yes, that’s spelled
            with <em>two </em><code>a's</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of my names, if mine hasn’t already betrayed me the word
            Salaar means "leader" so no pressure, right?
          </p>

            Long story short, I'm a tech enthusiast with a knack for building
            data-driven solutions and robust backends. I enjoy turning complex
            datasets into something meaningful and love optimizing the flow
            behind the scenes.

          <p>
            I'm currently diving into my Bachelor's in Software Engineering at
            the
            <a href="https://mcs.nust.edu.pk/ " rel="noopener"
              >Military College of Signals, NUST,</a
            >
            which I've been pursuing since 2022
          </p>

          <p>
            I thrive in collaborative environments that encourage growth, offer
            varied learning opportunities, and cultivate my problem-solving
            skills and creative strengths.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, I’m mostly focused on web development with React,
            JavaScript, and CSS, but I also have a solid foundation in
            general-purpose programming languages like C++, Python, and Java.
            Some of my interests in web development include typography,
            performance, and accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a self-proclaimed data nerd, I thrive on all things data and
            strategy!There’s just something cool about building data pipelines
            and wrangling huge datasets to uncover insights. Whether I’m
            figuring out how to get data from one place to another or optimizing
            how it’s stored, I love the challenge of making everything run
            smoothly.

            I won’t bore you too much with my work history, though; that’s what

          <p>
            When I’m not coding, you’ll find me praising till I’m hollow. I’m a
            die-hard geek. I love the challenging gameplay, intricate lore,
            jolly co-operation ang general "fun". But I enjoy : shooters, RPGs,
            roguelites, platformers, you name it. I was practically raised by a
            generation of browser Flash games—may they rest in peace—and an
            unhealthy amount of (Old School) Runescape, and these experiences
            with video games have shaped my interests and personality to this
            day. Some games have left such a lasting impression on me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I’m sure you’re dying to know, some of my favorite video games
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>God of War</li>
            <li>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</li>
            <li>Eldin Ring</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>… and many other great titles.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I could talk about games for hours, so I’m just going to stop here
            before you fall asleep.

            <a class="to-underline" href="#reading">Reading</a>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Every now and then, I’ll dust off a book and do some light reading.
            I love finding that rare book that captivates me so much that time
            slips away, where closing it almost feels like waking from a dream.
            A few of my favorites include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Collected Stories by Gabriel García Márquez</li>
            <li>The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde</li>
            <li>Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky</li>
            <li>No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai</li>
            <li>Letters from a Stoic by Seneca</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I don’t have a reading list per se, although there are some books
            I’d like to one day read… Okay, I guess that’s
            <em>technically</em> a reading list, but hopefully you get my point.
            I don’t like to treat reading as something to check off a list
            because then it feels like work.

            There’s more to my life than what I feel comfortable sharing here,
